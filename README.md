### variables.sh

The target of this exercise is to create a string, an integer, and a complex variable using command substitution. The string should be named BIRTHDATE and should contain the text "Jan 1, 2000". The integer should be named Presents and should contain the number 10. The complex variable should be named BIRTHDAY and should contain the full weekday name of the day matching the date in variable BIRTHDATE e.g. Saturday. Note that the 'date' command can be used to convert a date format into a different date format. 

### arrays-comparison.sh

In this exercise, you will need to compare three list of arrays and write the common elements of all the three arrays:
a=(3 5 8 10 6),b=(6 5 4 12),c=(14 7 5 7) result is the common element 5.

### basics-operators.sh

In this exercise, you will need to calculate to total cost (variable TOTAL) of a fruit basket, which contains 1 pineapple, 2 bananas and 3 watermelons. Don't forget to include the cost of the basket....

### basics-strings-operations.sh

In this exercise, you will need to change Warren Buffett's known saying. First create a variable ISAY and assign it the original saying value. Then re-assign it with a new changed value using the string operations and following the 4 defined changes: Change1: replace the first occurrence of 'snow' with 'foot'. Change2: delete the second occurrence of 'snow'. Change3: replace 'finding' with 'getting'. Change4: delete all characters following 'wet'. Tip: One way to implement Change4, if to find the index of 'w' in the word 'wet' and then use substring extraction.

### loop.sh

In this exercise, you will need to loop through and print out all even numbers from the numbers list in the same order they are received. Don't print any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence.
